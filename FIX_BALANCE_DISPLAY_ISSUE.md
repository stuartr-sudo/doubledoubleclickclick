# Fix: Balance Display Issue

## Problem
- Top menu shows **$5.00** instead of **$1000.00**
- "Low account balance" banner appears even though you have $1000.00
- Database has correct value ($1000.00) but frontend shows old cached value

## Root Cause
The frontend is caching the old user object from when you first logged in (before the balance was updated to $1000).

## Solutions

### ✅ Quick Fix (Immediate)
**Log out and log back in** to refresh the user session:

1. Click your name in the top menu
2. Click "Log Out"
3. Log back in
4. Balance should now show **$1000.00**
5. Banner should disappear

### ✅ Code Fix (Applied)
I've updated the `BalanceTopUpBanner` component to:
- **Exclude superadmins** from seeing the low balance banner
- Increase threshold to $5.00 (so it only shows when balance is critically low)
- This means superadmins will NEVER see the banner, regardless of balance

## Verification Steps

### 1. Check Database Balance
Run this in Supabase SQL Editor:
```sql
SELECT email, account_balance, is_superadmin 
FROM user_profiles 
WHERE is_superadmin = true;
```
**Expected**: `account_balance = 1000.00`

### 2. After Logging Out/In
- Top menu should show: **$1000.00**
- Banner should NOT appear
- User Management should show: `1000.00` in the Account Balance field

## Changes Made

### File: `src/components/common/BalanceTopUpBanner.jsx`
```javascript
// Added superadmin check
const isSuperadmin = currentUser.is_superadmin || currentUser.role === 'superadmin';
const shouldShow = (
  currentBalance < 5.00 &&
  !isNewUser &&
  !isDismissed &&
  !isSuperadmin  // NEW: Superadmins never see the banner
);
```

## Why This Happens

The user object is loaded once when you log in and stored in React state:
1. You logged in → user object loaded with `account_balance: 5.00`
2. You ran SQL to update balance to $1000.00 in database
3. Frontend still has old cached object with $5.00
4. **Solution**: Log out/in to refresh the cached object

## Future Enhancement (Optional)

To avoid this in the future, we could add a "Refresh Balance" button or auto-refresh on page load. For now, logging out/in is the simplest solution.
