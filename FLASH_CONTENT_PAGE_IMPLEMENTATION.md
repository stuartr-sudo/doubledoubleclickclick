# Flash Feature Implementation - Content Page

## ‚úÖ Implementation Complete

The Flash workflow functionality has been successfully integrated into the Content page, allowing users to run AI enhancement workflows on their own written content (not just AI-generated content from Topics).

---

## üéØ What Was Implemented

### 1. Flash Button Integration
- **Location**: Actions column on the Content page (between Delete and Publish buttons)
- **Component**: Reused existing `FlashButton.jsx` component
- **Status**: ‚úÖ Already present in the codebase

### 2. Three Required Validations

#### ‚úÖ Empty Content Check
```javascript
if (!item.content || item.content.trim() === "") {
  toast.error("Cannot flash: Article content is empty");
  return;
}
```

#### ‚úÖ 400-Word Minimum
```javascript
const countWords = (html) => {
  if (!html) return 0;
  const text = html.replace(/<[^>]*>/g, ' ').replace(/\s+/g, ' ').trim();
  return text.split(' ').filter(word => word.length > 0).length;
};

if (wordCount < MIN_WORD_COUNT) {
  toast.error(`Cannot flash: Article must be at least ${MIN_WORD_COUNT} words (currently ${wordCount} words)`);
  return;
}
```

#### ‚úÖ No Re-Flashing Completed Articles
```javascript
if (item.flash_status === "completed") {
  toast.error("This article has already been flashed and cannot be re-flashed");
  return;
}
```

### 3. Enhanced Tooltips with Timestamps

The button tooltip now shows:
- **Completed**: `"Flashed on 1/25/2025 at 3:45:23 PM"` (using `item.flashed_at`)
- **Running**: `"Flash in progress..."`
- **Failed**: `"Flash failed - click to retry"`
- **Too Short**: `"Content too short (250/400 words)"`
- **Idle**: `"Run flash workflow"`

---

## üé® Visual States (Unchanged)

The Flash button displays different states:

| State | Icon | Color | Disabled | Tooltip |
|-------|------|-------|----------|---------|
| **Idle** | ‚ö° Zap | Pink/Rose gradient | No | "Run flash workflow" |
| **Running** | üîÑ Spinner | Blue gradient | Yes | "Flash in progress..." |
| **Completed** | ‚úì CheckCircle | Green gradient | Yes | "Flashed on [date] at [time]" |
| **Failed** | ‚ö† AlertCircle | Orange/Amber gradient | No | "Flash failed - click to retry" |

---

## üîÑ Flash Workflow Execution Flow

### User Clicks Flash Button
```
1. Validate content is not empty
2. Validate word count >= 400
3. Validate flash_status != "completed"
4. Open RunWorkflowModal (background mode)
```

### User Selects Workflow & Runs
```
5. Check/consume tokens
6. Update UI to "running" (optimistic)
7. Invoke functions/executeEditorWorkflow (server-side)
8. Poll WorkflowRunStatus every 2s
```

### Server-Side Execution
```
9. Create WorkflowRunStatus record (status="running")
10. Loop through workflow_steps (TL;DR, Humanize, SEO, etc.)
11. Update progress_message after each step
12. Set status="completed", result_html=finalHtml
```

### UI Updates
```
13. Polling detects status change
14. Update flash_status badge to "Completed" (green ‚úì)
15. Show toast: "Flash completed for 'Article Title'"
16. Save updated content to BlogPost/WebhookReceived
```

---

## üìä Real-Time Polling System

The Content page uses **aggressive polling** to update Flash status badges in real-time:

- **Base interval**: 5 seconds
- **Stagger**: 300ms delay between checking each running item
- **Backoff**: On 429 rate limit, double interval (up to 30s max)
- **Reset**: On successful update, reset to 5s interval
- **Stop**: When no items are running, clear interval

---

## üîç Filtering

The Flash status filter dropdown allows filtering by:
- **All Flash** (default)
- **Not Flashed** (idle)
- **Running**
- **Completed**
- **Failed**

---

## üìù Data Model

### BlogPost & WebhookReceived
```javascript
{
  id: UUID,
  title: string,
  content: string (HTML),
  status: "draft" | "published" | "archived" | "received" | "editing",
  user_name: string,
  flash_status: "idle" | "running" | "completed" | "failed",
  flashed_at: ISO timestamp,
  flash_workflow_id: UUID,
  processing_id: string (for deduplication)
}
```

### WorkflowRunStatus
```javascript
{
  id: UUID,
  workflow_id: UUID,
  status: "pending" | "running" | "completed" | "failed",
  current_step_index: integer,
  current_step_name: string,
  progress_message: string,
  result_html: string,
  error_message: string,
  started_at: timestamp,
  finished_at: timestamp
}
```

## üöÄ How Users Use It

### Scenario 1: Flash User-Written Content
```
1. User writes content in Editor (or pastes from external source)
2. Saves as BlogPost with status="draft"
3. Goes to Content page
4. Clicks Flash button (‚ö°) on their article
5. Selects Flash workflow (e.g., "SEO Polish")
6. Confirms token cost
7. Workflow runs in background
8. Content is enhanced and saved automatically
9. User can now publish to CMS
```

### Scenario 2: Flash Fails (Content Too Short)
```
1. User clicks Flash button
2. Toast: "Cannot flash: Article must be at least 400 words (currently 230 words)"
3. User goes back to Editor to add more content
4. Returns to Content page and retries
```

### Scenario 3: Attempt to Re-Flash
```
1. User clicks Flash button on completed article
2. Toast: "This article has already been flashed and cannot be re-flashed"
3. Button remains disabled (green ‚úì)
4. Tooltip shows: "Flashed on 1/25/2025 at 3:45:23 PM"
```

## üîß Technical Implementation Details

### Files Modified
- **`src/components/content/FlashButton.jsx`**
  - Added `countWords()` helper function
  - Added 400-word minimum validation
  - Enhanced tooltip with `flashed_at` timestamp
  - Improved validation error messages

### Files Already Present (No Changes Needed)
- **`src/pages/Content.jsx`**: FlashButton already integrated at line 814
- **`src/components/editor/RunWorkflowModal.jsx`**: Handles workflow selection and execution
- **`functions/executeEditorWorkflow`**: Server-side Flash execution
- **`entities/WorkflowRunStatus.json`**: Real-time status tracking

---

## üéØ Key Business Rules

1. **No Re-Flashing**: Once an article is flashed (`flash_status = "completed"`), it cannot be flashed again. This prevents:
   - Token waste
   - Over-optimization
   - Unintended content changes

2. **Minimum Content Requirement**: 400 words ensures:
   - Meaningful Flash workflows (e.g., TL;DR needs sufficient content)
   - Quality content output
   - Prevents wasted Flash executions on stub articles

3. **Flash Status Tracking**: All articles track their Flash state:
   - `idle`: Never flashed (default)
   - `running`: Flash in progress (polling active)
   - `completed`: Flash finished successfully (button disabled)
   - `failed`: Flash encountered error (button enabled for retry)
