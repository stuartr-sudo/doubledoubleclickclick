## üöÄ Deployment Steps

### Step 1: Run SQL Scripts in Supabase

Run these scripts in order in your Supabase SQL Editor:

1. **Database Migration** (if not already run):
   ```bash
   # File: supabase/migrations/031_dollar_balance_system.sql
   ```

2. **Superadmin Setup**:
   ```bash
   # File: SETUP_SUPERADMIN_BALANCE.sql
   ```

3. **Verification** (optional but recommended):
   ```bash
   # File: VERIFY_BALANCE_MIGRATION.sql
   ```

### Step 2: Verify Environment Variables in Vercel

Ensure these are set in your Vercel project:

- ‚úÖ `STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` - Your Stripe publishable key
- ‚úÖ `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` - Your Stripe secret key
- ‚úÖ `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` - Your Stripe webhook signing secret
- ‚úÖ `SUPABASE_URL` - Your Supabase project URL
- ‚úÖ `SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY` - Your Supabase service role key (for backend)
- ‚úÖ `VITE_SUPABASE_URL` - Your Supabase project URL (for frontend)
- ‚úÖ `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` - Your Supabase anon key (for frontend)
- ‚úÖ `OPENAI_API_KEY` - Your OpenAI API key

### Step 3: Deploy to Vercel

```bash
# In your project directory:
git add .
git commit -m "feat: migrate from tokens to dollar balance system"
git push origin main
```

Vercel will automatically deploy your changes.

### Step 4: Set Up Stripe Webhook (if not already set)

1. Go to Stripe Dashboard ‚Üí Developers ‚Üí Webhooks
2. Add endpoint: `https://your-domain.vercel.app/api/stripe/webhook`
3. Select events to listen for:
   - `checkout.session.completed`
   - `payment_intent.succeeded`
   - `payment_intent.payment_failed`
4. Copy the webhook signing secret to Vercel env vars as `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET`
