# Autosave Investigation Report

## Search Results:

Looking through the Editor.jsx file (4,336 lines), I found references to autosave:

### Lines 2542-2545:
```javascript
localStorage.removeItem('editor_draft_title');
localStorage.removeItem('editor_draft_content');
localStorage.removeItem('autosave-title');
localStorage.removeItem('autosave-content');
```

This shows autosave data is stored in localStorage but cleared during initialization.

## Current Status:

**I need to search for the actual autosave implementation:**
- Where is the setInterval/setTimeout for autosave?
- What triggers the autosave?
- What is the autosave interval?

Let me check if there's a separate autosave hook or if it's implemented differently.
