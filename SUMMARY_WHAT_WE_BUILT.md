   - ✅ All required fields

2. **usernames** (Workspaces)
   - ✅ `user_name` as TEXT (unique identifier)
   - ✅ `display_name` for UI
   - ✅ `assigned_to` (owner)
   - ✅ `is_active` status

3. **blog_posts**
   - ✅ ALL columns frontend expects
   - ✅ `user_name` for workspace ownership

   - ✅ `featured_image` (was missing!)
   - ✅ `tags` as TEXT[]
   - ✅ Proper timestamps

4. **webhook_received**
   - ✅ External content imports
   - ✅ Same structure as blog_posts
   - ✅ Source tracking

5. **feature_flags**
   - ✅ Correct column names (`flag_name`, `is_enabled`)
   - ✅ Token cost tracking
   - ✅ Description, category fields

6. **llm_settings** (YOUR NEW ADDITION!)
   - ✅ Per-feature AI configuration
   - ✅ Model, temperature, tokens
   - ✅ System and user prompts
   - ✅ Usage tracking
   - ✅ Enable/disable toggle

7. **integration_credentials**
   - ✅ Publishing platform credentials
   - ✅ WordPress, Shopify, Google Docs, etc.
   - ✅ Encrypted storage (JSONB)

---

### **RLS Policies (No More Recursion!):**

#### Simple & Secure:
- ✅ Security definer function: `is_admin_user()`
- ✅ No recursive queries
- ✅ Direct array checks with `ANY()`
- ✅ Separate policies for SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE

#### Access Control:
- ✅ Users see their assigned workspaces
- ✅ Admins see everything
- ✅ Published content is public
- ✅ Simple, predictable rules
