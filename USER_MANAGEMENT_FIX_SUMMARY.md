# User Management Fix - Complete Summary

## ✅ What Was Fixed

### 1. **Database Schema** ✅ APPLIED
- Added missing columns to `user_profiles`:
  - `access_level` (TEXT, default 'edit')
  - `show_publish_options` (BOOLEAN, default true)
  - `department` (TEXT, default '')
- All other fields already existed (token_balance, topics, etc.)

### 2. **RLS Security** ✅ APPLIED  
- Created `is_current_user_admin()` SECURITY DEFINER function
- Updated RLS policy: "Users can read own profile or admins can read all"
- This allows admins to view all users without infinite recursion

### 3. **Frontend Code** ✅ DEPLOYED (commit ca47c11)
- Fixed `User` entity in `src/api/entities.js`:
  ```javascript
  export const User = {
    ...app.auth,  // Auth methods (me, updateMe, logout)
    ...app.entities.UserProfile,  // CRUD (list, filter, etc.)
  };
  ```
- Now `User.list()` works correctly

## 📊 Current Database State

**Users in database:** 3
1. stuarta@doubleclick.work - User, 20 tokens
2. stuartr@doubleclick.work - Superadmin, 800 tokens  
3. stuart.asta@doubleclick.work - Admin/Superadmin, 1000 tokens

**All required fields present:**
- ✅ token_balance
- ✅ completed_tutorial_ids
- ✅ topics
- ✅ topics_onboarding_completed_at (JSONB)
- ✅ access_level
- ✅ show_publish_options
- ✅ department
- ✅ assigned_usernames
- ✅ topics_timer_hours
- ✅ topics_timer_override

## 🚀 Next Steps

### FOR YOU:
1. **Wait 1-2 minutes** for Vercel to finish deploying (it auto-deploys from GitHub)
2. **Hard refresh** the User Management page (Cmd+Shift+R)
3. You should now see all 3 users with complete data

### If users still don't appear:
1. Check Vercel deployment logs for errors
2. Check browser console for errors (F12)
3. Try logging out and back in (to refresh your auth token)

## 🔍 How to Verify It's Working

In your browser console (F12), run this:
```javascript
// This should return 3 users (not an error)
const { User } = await import('/src/api/entities.js');
const users = await User.list();
console.log('Users:', users);
```

If you see an array with 3 user objects, the fix is working!

## 📝 What Was The Root Cause?

The original issue had multiple layers:
1. **User entity only had auth methods**, not CRUD methods (no `list()`)
2. **RLS policy prevented admins from viewing all users** (only own profile)
3. **Some UI columns were missing** in the database schema

All three issues have been resolved! 🎉
